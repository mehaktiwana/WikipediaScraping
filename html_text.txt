<p>Born and raised in the <a href=""/wiki/Austrian_Empire"" title=""Austrian Empire"">Austrian Empire</a>, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in <a href=""/wiki/Telephony"" title=""Telephony"">telephony</a> and at <a href=""/wiki/Continental_Edison"" title=""Continental Edison"">Continental Edison</a> in the new <a href=""/wiki/Electric_power_industry"" title=""Electric power industry"">electric power industry</a>. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Naturalized_citizen"" title=""Naturalized citizen"">naturalized citizen</a>. He worked for a short time at the <a href=""/wiki/Edison_Machine_Works"" title=""Edison Machine Works"">Edison Machine Works</a> in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC <a href=""/wiki/Induction_motor"" title=""Induction motor"">induction motor</a> and related <a href=""/wiki/Polyphase_system"" title=""Polyphase system"">polyphase</a> AC patents, licensed by <a href=""/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation"" title=""Westinghouse Electric Corporation"">Westinghouse Electric</a> in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.
</p>
<p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical <a href=""/wiki/Oscillation"" title=""Oscillation"">oscillators</a>/generators, <a href=""/wiki/Electric_discharge"" title=""Electric discharge"">electrical discharge</a> tubes, and early <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/X-Ray_imaging"" title=""X-Ray imaging"">X-ray imaging</a>. He also built a <a href=""/wiki/Wireless"" title=""Wireless"">wirelessly</a> controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and <a href=""/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado"" title=""Colorado Springs, Colorado"">Colorado Springs</a>. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Wireless_communication"" title=""Wireless communication"">wireless communication</a> with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished <a href=""/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower"" title=""Wardenclyffe Tower"">Wardenclyffe Tower</a> project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.
</p>
<p>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">[8]</a></sup> Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the <a href=""/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures"" title=""General Conference on Weights and Measures"">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> named the <a href=""/wiki/International_System_of_Units"" title=""International System of Units"">International System of Units</a> (SI) measurement of <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Magnetic_flux_density"" title=""Magnetic flux density"">magnetic flux density</a> the <a href=""/wiki/Tesla_(unit)"" title=""Tesla (unit)"">tesla</a> in his honor.

<p>In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor.

<p>During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed.

<p>A special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and models of Tesla's induction motor.

<p>An observer noted:
</p>
<p>Within the room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet apart and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous.

Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTECarlson2013167–173_125-0""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarlson2013167–173-125"">[124]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTECarlson2013205–206_126-0""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarlson2013205–206-126"">[125]</a></sup> It found few investors since the mid-1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla's patents for decades to come.
</p>
<p>In the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told <i><a href=""/wiki/The_New_York_Times"" title=""The New York Times"">The New York Times</a></i> ""I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-127""><a href=""#cite_note-127"">[126]</a></sup>  After the fire Tesla moved to 46 &amp; 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.
</p>
<p>Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as <a href=""/wiki/Radiant_energy"" title=""Radiant energy"">radiant energy</a> of ""invisible"" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-128""><a href=""#cite_note-128"">[127]</a></sup> (later identified as ""Roentgen rays"" or ""<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/X-rays"" title=""X-rays"">X-rays</a>""). His early experiments were with <a href=""/wiki/Crookes_tube"" title=""Crookes tube"">Crookes tubes</a>, a <a href=""/wiki/Cold_cathode"" title=""Cold cathode"">cold cathode</a> electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, <a href=""/wiki/Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen"" title=""Wilhelm Röntgen"">Wilhelm Röntgen</a>'s December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a <a href=""/wiki/Geissler_tube"" title=""Geissler tube"">Geissler tube</a>, an earlier type of gas discharge tube.

</p>
<p>In March 1896, after hearing of Röntgen's discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (<a href=""/wiki/Radiography"" title=""Radiography"">radiography</a>),<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-130""><a href=""#cite_note-130"">[129]</a></sup> Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high-energy single-terminal <a href=""/wiki/Vacuum_tube"" title=""Vacuum tube"">vacuum tube</a> of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is <i><a href=""/wiki/Bremsstrahlung"" title=""Bremsstrahlung"">bremsstrahlung</a></i> or <i>braking radiation</i>). In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the ""instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-131""><a href=""#cite_note-131"">[130]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the <a href=""/wiki/Ozone"" title=""Ozone"">ozone</a> generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by <a href=""/wiki/Nitrous_acid"" title=""Nitrous acid"">nitrous acid</a>. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in <a href=""/wiki/Waves_in_plasmas"" title=""Waves in plasmas"">waves in plasmas</a>. These plasma waves can occur in <a href=""/wiki/Force-free_magnetic_field"" title=""Force-free magnetic field"">force-free magnetic fields</a>.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-132""><a href=""#cite_note-132"">[131]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-133""><a href=""#cite_note-133"">[132]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>On 11 July 1934, the <i><a href=""/wiki/New_York_Herald_Tribune"" title=""New York Herald Tribune"">New York Herald Tribune</a></i> published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that occasionally took place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes. A minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him:<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Anderson_134-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Anderson-134"">[133]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his ""electric gun"", Tesla said, ""The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations"".

</p>
<p>From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop <a href=""/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer"" title=""Wireless power transfer"">the transmission of electrical power without wires</a>. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.
</p>
<p>At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of the existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTECarlson2013127_139-0""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarlson2013127-139"">[138]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-earlyradiohistory.us_140-0""><a href=""#cite_note-earlyradiohistory.us-140"">[139]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-141""><a href=""#cite_note-141"">[140]</a></sup> Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-142""><a href=""#cite_note-142"">[141]</a></sup> Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of ""invisible light"" would diminish over a distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming ""hopelessly lost"".<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTECarlson2013209_143-0""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarlson2013209-143"">[142]</a></sup>

<p>By the mid-1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Magnifying_transmitter"" title=""Magnifying transmitter"">magnifying transmitter</a> in his East Houston Street lab.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-My_Inventions_144-0""><a href=""#cite_note-My_Inventions-144"">[143]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-145""><a href=""#cite_note-145"">[144]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-146""><a href=""#cite_note-146"">[145]</a></sup> Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth's atmosphere was conductive,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTESeifer1996107_147-0""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTESeifer1996107-147"">[146]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTECarlson201345_148-0""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarlson201345-148"">[147]</a></sup> he proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet (9,100 m) in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances.

<p>Tesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller <a href=""/wiki/Subatomic_particle"" title=""Subatomic particle"">subatomic particles</a>, stating there was no such thing as an <a href=""/wiki/Electron"" title=""Electron"">electron</a> creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or ""sub-atom"" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEO'Neill1944249_265-0""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Neill1944249-265"">[264]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-266""><a href=""#cite_note-266"">[265]</a></sup> Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way.

</p>
<p>I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-269""><a href=""#cite_note-269"">[268]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1935 he described relativity as ""a beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king"" and said his own experiments had measured the speed of cosmic rays from Arcturus as fifty times the speed of light.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-270""><a href=""#cite_note-270"">[269]</a></sup>

<p>Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEO'Neill1944247_268-1""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEO'Neill1944247-268"">[267]</a></sup> and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a ""dynamic theory of gravity"" that ""[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space"". He stated that the theory was ""worked out in all details"" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-271""><a href=""#cite_note-271"">[270]</a></sup> Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTECheney2001309_272-0""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTECheney2001309-272"">[271]</a></sup>

<p>Tesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a <a href=""/wiki/Humanism"" title=""Humanism"">humanist</a> in philosophical outlook.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJonnes2004154_273-0""><a href=""#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJonnes2004154-273"">[272]</a></sup><sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-274""><a href=""#cite_note-274"">[273]</a></sup> This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, from becoming a proponent of an imposed <a href=""/wiki/Selective_breeding"" title=""Selective breeding"">selective breeding</a> version of <a href=""/wiki/Eugenics"" title=""Eugenics"">eugenics</a>.
</p>
<p>Tesla expressed the belief that human ""pity"" had come to interfere with the natural ""ruthless workings of nature"". Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a ""master race"" or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated:
</p>
<p>... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-275""><a href=""#cite_note-275"">[274]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward <a href=""/wiki/Gender_equality"" title=""Gender equality"">gender equality</a>, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by ""<a href=""/wiki/Queen_bee_(sociology)"" title=""Queen bee (sociology)"">Queen Bees</a>"".

<p>Tesla was raised an <a href=""/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church"" title=""Eastern Orthodox Church"">Orthodox Christian</a>. Later in life he did not consider himself to be a ""believer in the orthodox sense"", said he opposed <a href=""/wiki/Religious_fanaticism"" title=""Religious fanaticism"">religious fanaticism</a>, and said ""Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance.""<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Viereck1937_278-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Viereck1937-278"">[277]</a></sup> He also said ""To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end"" and ""what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body.
